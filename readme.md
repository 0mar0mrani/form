## Form - with TS & React
The project simple form made with TS and React. This is my first time using React. The purpose of this project is the exercise of how to track the states of the form while learning the basics of React. I've deliberately not used form-libraries to better understand React. 

See a live demo [here](simple-form-ts-react.netlify.app).

# Disclaimer
The look of the the form has not been prioritized.
